## Getting Started

If you are new to pwn.college, or missed the opening lectures, you can see a quickstart video [here](https://youtu.be/DJO1A2neZ6Y).

### If you are NOT familiar with Linux

Go ahead and get started on the first module `Hello Hackers` and work your way down to `Pondering PATH`. 

These are the same modules as found in the [Linux Luminarium](https://pwn.college/linux-luminarium/) dojo.

### If you ARE familiar with Linux

Take your pick of any of the modules, and feel free to jump around the main site as well! This dojo will be updated with new content as the semester progresses.
